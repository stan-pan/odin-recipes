        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chow Mein Noodles: </strong>Chow mein noodles are 
                    made with wheat and egg. They are very similar to Italian 
                    pasta noodles and have a wonderful bite to them. 
                    Most grocery stores carry dry chow mein noodles in the 
                    Asian aisle. But, if you are lucky, you will find pre-cooked
                     chow mein noodles in the refrigerated section that can be 
                     thrown straight into your pan.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>Carrots, cabbage, green onions,
                     and bean sprouts are the perfect combination of veggies 
                     to use for chow mein. However, they can easily be 
                     replaced with other veggies like bok choy, celery, 
                     broccoli, spinach, kale or baby corn. Feel free to get 
                     creative and use what you like or whatever you have hanging 
                     around in your fridge! </li>
                <li><strong>Meats: </strong>Great quality chicken breasts are 
                    your best bet for slicing into chow mein-ready strips. If 
                    you like, feel free to swap chicken out for beef, 
                    shrimp or pork. </li>
                <li><strong>Chow Mein Sauce: </strong> The homemade chow mein 
                    sauce is amazing in this recipe! Combine soy sauce, light 
                    sesame oil, oyster sauce, granulated sugar, cornstarch, 
                    and chicken broth to make the signature sweet and savory 
                    sauce that makes chow mein taste authentic.</li>

        <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine ingredients for chow mein sauce:
                 oyster sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, chicken broth, and 
                 cornstarch. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, set aside. </li>
            <li>Heat a large wok or pan. Add a bit of oil to the pan and cook
                 chicken until it's golden brown. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, cabbage and pressed garlic and saute for a few 
                minutes until veggies are slightly softened. </li>
            <li>Add chicken back to the pan, followed by cooked noodles and 
                pour the sauce right on top. Cook for about 2 minutes, 
                distributing all that saucy goodness around evenly.</li>
            <li>Add chopped green onions and remove from the heat. Serve hot!</li>
