                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105&deg;F - 115&deg;F</li>
                    <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza 
                        in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Toppings: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Cornmeal</li>
                    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>Any pizza ingredient of your choice</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <h3><strong>Making the Pizza Dough</strong></h3>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Proof the Yeast:</li></h3>
                        <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a 
                            heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast 
                            over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes 
                            until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
                        <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved 
                            completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, 
                            indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
                        <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead 
                            of "active yeast", no proofing is required. 
                            Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>

                    <img src="../images/yeast.jpg" alt="yeast">

                    <h3><li>Make and knead the pizza dough:</li></h3>
                        <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using 
                            the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed 
                            for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with 
                            the dough hook attachment.</p>
                        <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using 
                            the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>
                        <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the 
                            ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>
                        <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or 
                            tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, 
                            sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>

                    <img src="../images/dough.jpg" alt="dough">

                    <h3><li>Let the dough rise:</li></h3>
                        <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a 
                            large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn 
                            it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
                        <p>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough 
                            to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation 
                            (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex 
                            flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation 
                            (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise 
                            sufficiently to work with.</p>
                        <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>
                        <p>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place 
                            (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room 
                            temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) 
                            for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in 
                            the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).</p>
                        <p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor 
                            the crust will have.</p>

                        <h4>Make-Ahead and Freezing Instructions For Dough</h4>
                            <p>After the pizza dough has risen, you can freeze it to use later. 
                                Divide the dough in half (or the portion sizes you will be 
                                using to make your pizzas). Place on parchment paper 
                                or a lightly floured dish and place, uncovered, 
                                in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Then remove from 
                                the freezer, and place in individual freezer bags, removing 
                                as much air as you can from the bags. Return to the freezer 
                                and store for up to 3 months.</p>
                            <p>Thaw the pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight 
                                or for 5 to 6 hours. Then let the dough sit at room 
                                temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it out 
                                in the next steps.</p>
                </ol>
            <h3><strong>Preparing the Pizzas</strong></h3>
                <ol>
                    <h2><li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet)</li></h2>
                        <p>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. 
                            Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, 
                            preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can 
                            use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something 
                            that will not warp at high temperatures.</p>
                    
                    <h2><li>Divide the dough into two balls: </li></h2>
                        <p>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands 
                            with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. 
                            Divide the dough in half.</p>
                        <p>Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, 
                            cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes 
                            (or up to 2 hours).</p>
                        
                            <img src = "../images/2-balls.jpg" alt="2 dough balls">

                    <h2><li>Prep the toppings:</li></h2>
                        <p>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not 
                            going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of 
                            toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.</p>
                        <p>About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese 
                            would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two 
                            mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</p>

                    <h2><li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:</li></h2>
                        <p>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball 
                            of dough and flatten it with your hands on a 
                            lightly floured work surface.</p>
                        <p>Starting at the center and working outwards, 
                            use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch 
                            thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will 
                            not stretch further.</p>
                        <p>Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue 
                            to stretch it until it reaches the desired 
                            diameter—10 to 12 inches.</p>
                        <p>Treat the dough gently!</p>
                        <p>You can also hold up the edges of the dough with 
                            your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, 
                            while working around the edges of the dough.</p>
                        <p>If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough 
                            on a floured surface and push the dough back 
                            together to seal the hole.</p>
                        <p>Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough 
                            where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you 
                            want to form a lip.</p>

                    <h2><li>Brush the dough top with olive oil:</li></h2>
                        <p>Use your fingertips to press down and make dents 
                            along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. 
                            Brush the top of the dough with olive oil 
                            (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). 
                            Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Repeat with the second ball of dough.</p>
                    
                    <h2><li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top:</li></h2>
                        <p>Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) 
                            with cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little ball
                             bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel 
                             into the oven.)</p>
                        <p>Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.</p>
                        <p>If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, 
                            lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.</p>

                    <h2><li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</li></h2>
                        <p>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your 
                            desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload 
                            the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</p>

                    <h2><li>Sprinkle the cornmeal on pizza stone, slide pizza onto pizza stone in oven:</li></h2>
                        <p>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven 
                            (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the 
                            peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, 
                            gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.</p>
                        <p>Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</p>

                    <h2><li>Bake: </li></h2>
                        <p>Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the 
                            crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 
                            10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of 
                            the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese. Enjoy!</p>
